## The Kirby Institute

[The Kirby Institute](https://www.kirby.unsw.edu.au/) is a world-leading health research institute at [UNSW Sydney](https://www.unsw.edu.au/). We work to eliminate infectious diseases, globally. Our specialisation is in developing health solutions for the most at-risk communities. Putting communities at the heart of our research, we develop tests, treatments, cures and prevention strategies that have the greatest chance of success.
